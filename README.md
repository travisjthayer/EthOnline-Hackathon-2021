Collectible Challenge
Entry for EthOnline Hackathon 2021

Take your existing NFT collectibles and challenge other owners in matchups.  

For instance, as the proud owner of a Patrick Mahomes NFT you issue a challenge to the owner of a Tom Brady NFT.

A sample challenge would be that Patrick Mahomes will have more yards in his game this week than Brady.

The challenge result will be verified using an oracle (i.e., Chainlink) once each person's game is completed.

For purposes of the hackathon, this contract will take 2 NFTs, allow the terms of the challenge to be set (i.e., 1 Eth) and the rules of the challenge (i.e., most yards or highest QBR).

Upon verification using the Chainlink oracle, the wager will be settled to the winning account holder.
